SYNOPSIS
      use HTML::DWT;
      
      $template = new HTML::DWT(filename => "file.html");    
      %dataHash = (doctitle => '<title>DWT Generated</title>');  
      $html = $template->fill(\%dataHash);
      
      or
      
      use HTML::DWT qw(:Template);
      
      $template = new HTML::DWT(filename => "file.dwt");
      $template->param(
                       doctitle => '<title>DWT Generated</title>'
                       leftcont => 'Some HTML content here'
                       );
      $html = $template->output();

DESCRIPTION
    A perl module designed to parse a simple HTML template file
    generated by Macromedia Dreamweaver and replace fields in the
    template with values from a CGI script.

METHODS
  Options

      use HTML::DWT qw(:Template);

    Using the Template option allows for built in support in
    HTML::DWT for the HTML::Template invocation syntax (param(),
    output() etc.) See HTML::Template for more details. It is best
    to require a version of 2.05 for HTML::DWT to support this
    option.

  new()

      new HTML::DWT("file.dwt");

      new HTML::DWT(filename => "file.dwt");

    Creates and returns a new HTML::DWT object based on the
    Dreamweaver template 'file.dwt' (can specify a relative or
    absolute path). The Second instance is recommended, although the
    first style is still supported for backwards compatability with
    versions before 2.05.

    Additional options may be passed to the constructor to emulate
    HTML::Template behavior (see that module's documentation)
    although only filename is supported as of HTML::DWT version
    2.05.

  fill()

      $template->fill(\%dataHash);

      $template->fillTemplate(\%dataHash);

    Takes a hash reference where the keys are the named areas of the
    template and the associated values are HTML content for those
    areas. This method returns a complete HTML document, which can
    then be sent to STDOUT (the browser). The fill() method is the
    prefered means of accessing this functionality; fillTemplate()
    is implemented only to support versions of HTML::DWT earlier
    than version 2.05.

  param()

      $template->param();

      $template->param('doctitle');

      $template->param(
                      doctitle => '<title>DWT Generated</title>'
                      leftcont => 'Some HTML content here'
                      );

    Takes a hash of one or more key/value pairs, where each key is a
    named area of the template, and the associated value is the HTML
    content for that area. This method returns void (HTML
    substitiutions are stored within the object awaiting output()).

    If called with a single paramter--this parameter must be a valid
    field name--param() returns the value currently set for the
    field, or undef if no value has been set.

    If called with no parameters, param() returns a list of all
    field names.

    NOTE: All Dreamweaver templates store the HTML page's title in a
    field named 'doctitle'. HTML::DWT will accept a raw title
    (without <title> tags) and will add the appropriate tags if the
    content of the 'doctitle' field should require them.

    This is a HTML::Template compatible method.

  output()

      $template->output();

    Returns the parsed template and its substituted HTML for output.
    The template must be filled using either fill() or param()
    before calling output().

    This is a HTML::Template compatible method.

  query()

      $template->query();

      $template->query('doctitle');

      $template->query(name => 'doctitle');

    Returns the 'type' of the template field specified. For all
    HTML::DWT fields the type is 'VAR' (HTML::DWT doesn't support
    HTML::Template's idea of LOOPs or IFs). If called with no
    parameters, query() returns a list of all field names.

    This is a HTML::Template compatible method.

DIAGNOSTICS
    Template File $file not opened:
        (F) The template file was not opened properly. This message
        is stored in $HTML::DWT::errmsg

BUGS
    No known bugs, but if you find any please contact the author.

COMPATABILITY NOTES
    HTML:DWT is moving towards supporting much, if not all of the
    functionality of HTML::Template for Dreamweaver templates. Not
    All HTML::Template functionality is fully supported yet, and
    while the HTML::Template documentation should be the reference
    source for all HTML::Template compatible methods and functions,
    only those methods documented as being supported, and the manner
    of their support as documented in HTML::DWT are actually
    supported by this module.

    In plain english--RT(HTML:DWT)M and use it. :)

    If you would like to assist in the development of this module,
    please contact the author.
